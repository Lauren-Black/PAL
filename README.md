# Interaction-Design-2-PAL
 This is a repository for commented code of in-class examples, meant to be used as a reference to support student understanding of in-class material.

 If you need additional assistance outside of class with the content, concepts or projects covered in class, I will be running our weekly PAL session on Tuesdays from 11am-12pm in J216. You can sign up for sessions with me on Tutor Ocean here: https://sheridan.tutorocean.com/tutor/LaurenBlack
